                <h1> Kofi Tetteh Hall</h1>
    
                <p>
                    Dr. Kofi Tetteh hall was constructed as a GETFund project in 2014. It was purported to house
                    about 540 students. The hall was named in honour of the second principal of the then KNUST
                    School of Mines, now University of Mines and Technology. This is noted as the largest residential
                    hall on campus with the finest rooms. The hall houses a number of provision stores, printing press
                    and a bistro to serve students. In addition to this, there are several TV rooms and study rooms. The
                    hall has about 4 floor compartments and located at the southern part of the UMaT campus. In this
                    project, a 3D model of the Dr. Kofi Tetteh hall was simulated
